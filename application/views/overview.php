<p>This website is a documented exploration focusing on the <b>Raspberry Pi</b>.  I am hosting this content off of the <b>Raspberry Pi</b>
in my living room.  A lot of trial and error went into setting up the the <b>Pi</b>, and this site is designed to be a 
resource for myself and others who are interested in exploring the technology.</p>

<p><strike>The specific <b>Raspberry Pi</b> that this site is being created on is the <b>256MB Model B</b> version of the <b>Pi</b>.  I'm expecting
the newer <b>512MB</b> model to come in the mail shortly.  I'm interested to see the difference in performance.  When
I run the "top" command in the <b>Pi's</b> shell, with <b>MySQL</b> server loaded (the biggest resource hog), I have around 12mb of RAM free
on the system.</p></strike>

<p>I swapped out the <b>SD</b> card from my <b>256MB Pi</b> and popped it in the new <b>512MB Pi</b>.  I reconfigured the port forwarding on my router
to look for the new <b>Pi</b>, and here I am.  I immediately reviewed my available resources and saw that the <b>RAM</b> is recognized, so fortunately I
don't have to reinstall the <b>OS</b>.</p>

<p>I've found the <b>Raspberry Pi</b> to be an excellent tool for learning and experimenting with multiple languages covering several areas 
of computing.</p>

<p><b><u>Web Development</u></b> - The <b>Pi</b> can be configured to run the <b>Apache</b> web server, <b>MySQL</b>, and <b>PHP</b> among other applications. 
 Within this web server installation, one can experiment with: <b>HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, SQL,</b> and many other web scripting languages.  This site
has been built using the lightweight <b>CodeIgniter</b> framework.  Aside from the cost of an internet connection, accessibility to these tools
is completely free.</p>

<p><b><u>Linux</u></b> - Even without a local monitor attached to the <b>Raspberry Pi</b>, a local (or remote) <b>SSH</b> connection can be established to directly interact 
with the <b>Pi</b>.  Using this cheap technology, one can safely learn to use the <b>Linux</b> environment while modifying user account access
and file permissions.  The default <b>Raspian Wheezy</b> distribution even comes preloaded with <b>Python</b> for development experimentation.  
Additionally, one can learn to program using other languages by installing free compilers.</p>
