<p>I'm not fully utilizing the capabilities of my <b>Pi's</b> server installation.  I have other dedicated servers I use that have the computing
power to manage a full website, but that does not take away from my curiosity of the <b>Pi's</b> capabilities.  The setup that I refer to in this
section will allow a user to fully access the configuration of a webserver with web scripting and database access.</p>

<p>Again, the <b>Pi</b> is a fully capable computer, and is advertised as an educational tool.  While keeping that in mind, one can use the <b>Pi</b>
to fully test and learn web application development.  The reference I use in this section describes the installation of the <b>Apache</b> web server,
<b>PHP5</b> backend scripting language interpreter, and <b>MySQL</b> database server.  This site has the <b>MySQL</b> database server running, but no
databases installed on it at this point.  The <b>MySQL</b> server is the biggest resource hog of RAM that I have running on my Pi by a long shot.</p>

<p>I have used the commands referenced <a href="http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/raspberrypi-webserver">here</a> to install all of my server software.</p>
